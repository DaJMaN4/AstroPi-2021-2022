## 1\. Introduction

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

> We decided to investigate to what extent volcanic activity like
> volcanic ash and testing of nuclear weapons affect vegetation on
> Earth, by comparing areas that are or have been affected, to areas
> that haven't. We also wanted to use the data we gathered from the ISS
> to compare it with old NDVI data from NASA\'s archive, but we decided
> to use another method because the data we got was not affected by
> circumstances we decided to measure at the same time NASA was
> gathering NDVI data. We think that this experiment is interesting
> because all of us like explosions, and we wanted to investigate how
> they affect vegetation on Earth. We expect to find out that volcanoes
> help vegetation to grow and that nuclear activity doesn't affect
> vegetation amount nearby.
