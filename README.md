# AstroPi-2021-2022
AstroPi Challenge is an international challeng for young people under 19 years old. 

Those students gather in grups to desing, write code and anylyse resulats.


# What is AstroPI about? 
It is about designing and gjennomføring of a scientific experiment in space. 

Astro pi by its self is a Raspberry pi 4 computer with sensors and camera and
neuron Accelilator for AI. 
Teams can choose which sensors and what sort of camera they want tu use. 

There are 3 options of hardware 

The first is sensors and accelelator but dont get view of earth, but on inside of ship.
So that teams can gather data just from inside of ISS.

Other option teams gets is same, but they get view of earth

The third is same as the second, only diffrence is that they get a filter on 
Camera that is called NDVI filter. This filter allow to take photos in diffrent
elektromagnetic spectrum, so that camera cannot see blue and red light. It will
see just long infrared light and green light. This helps to 

# About our Experiment 

Our experiment description is

Life on Earth 
With ousage of NDVI, we want to investigate to which extent does volcanic activity like volcanic ash and testing of nuclear weapon affect vegetation on Earth by compering gathered data to old satelite photos that we find on the NASA archive and areas that warent affected by volcanoes and/or nuclear activity. We hope that at the time of our investigation, the ISS will fly over at least one nuclear weapon testing area and one volcano-affected area. IF no - we are ony going to use the data we will happen to get, since volcanic activity can be found all over the world as volcanoes are as old as the Earth isself. 

Data
We plan to take NDVI photos


Team’s objective
We are gonna investigate how vegetation near radioactive and volcanic sites differ from normal plantlife

Method for achieving the objective
Our plan is to use our already written program to take hundreds of photos and save the location and time to a csv file. When we get our data back, we will search for images taken near places with radioactivity or volcanic activity, compare them with photos taken in other places and with photos taken a while ago in the same locations, which we could get from NASA archive

Expected results
We think that in volcanic affected areas there will be more vegetation then in normal sites because we assume that ash and ground heat may help plants to grow. In radioactive areas there will be the same amount of vegetation as in normal areas
